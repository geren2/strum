                    We are a platform dedicated to helping musicians of all levels find their groove, 
                    meet new bandmates, and create unforgettable music together.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect musicians of all skill levels and backgrounds, 
                    offering them a place to share their passion, learn from each other, and grow their talents.

        <!-- The Problem -->
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-center section-bg">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Many musicians struggle to find like-minded people to play with. 
                    They feel lost without a band or a sense of community. 
                    Strum solves this by providing a platform where artists can connect, 
                    collaborate, and improve their skills together.

                    We believe in the power of music as a community. 
                    By giving musicians the tools to find each other and create music, 
                    we help build a more connected and creative world.
